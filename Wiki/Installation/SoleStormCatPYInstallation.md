# SoleStormCatPY Installation
First, you must have Python 3.7 or later on your system (latest version reccomended.) Once you have Python installed, you may run one of the commands on your system (based on your OS):

## Windows
To install SoleStormCatPY onto Windows, you must have pip installed with your installation of Python. Check your installation file for this. After you have pip installed, you may run the command `py -m pip install -upgrade SoleStormCatPY` (`--upgrade` is optional if you are sure that SoleStormCatPY isn't on your system) in Command Prompt.

## Linux and MacOS
To install SoleStormCatPY onto a Linux Distibution, you must make sure that pip is installed on your system. If pip is not installed, check with your developer on how to install pip. Once pip is ready, run `python3 -m pip install --upgrade SoleStormCatPY` (where `--upgrade` is optional if you are sure that SoleStormCatPY isn't on your system) in your terminal.
