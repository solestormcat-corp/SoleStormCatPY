# appOpener
`appOpener` is an application that allows users to open appplications on a computer. Not all apps will be availible for all systems, and this is due to the way that operating systems are made.

## How To Use
Here is how to run `appOpener` in your terminal:
`import SoleStormCatPY.appOpener`
`appOpener.openAppManual(appname)`

Here is how to run `appOpener` through GUI:
`import SoleStormCatPY.appOpener`
`appOpener.openAppGUI()`

You can also open `appOpener` through the standalone app!

## Issues
There are a couple issues to this app (and I require your help!):

### Operating System Issue
Since all operating systems are differnt, some use certain apps, while some do not. Some apps are located in different locations on the systems. Windows puts the files for the app in different places due to user restrictions. This makes it impossible for all apps to be supported!

Sometimes, these systems put these files in the in the user's directory, and SoleStormCat Corp does not know how to fix this for apps on Windows machines (Linux and Mac use `~` as the home directory.)
