# ClockTimer
This application acts as a timer. The user can set the time (in minutes (Along with seconds and hours in the GUI)), or the developer can set the timer (in seconds). Everything will be printed out into the terminal (or the GUI), and will set the timer.

## How To Use
There is four different ways to use `ClockTimer`. The First being the process where the user sets the timer, the second being where the developer sets the timer, and the third being the GUI mode.
`import SoleStormCatPY.ClockTimer as PyTimer` and `PyTimer.clockTimerCMD()`
AND (Also Terminal)
`import SoleStormCatPY.ClockTimer as PyTimer` and `seconds = 12` and `PyTimer.clockTimerManual(seconds)`
AND (GUI)
`import SoleStormCatPY.ClockTimer as PyTimer` and `PyTimer.clockTimerGUI()`
AND FINALLY (GUI in Standalone App)
Open the Standalone app, and click the `ClockTimer` Button!
