# Files
Files is a basic file program, allowing you to open files/folders, to rename files, and to delete files/folders. This runs in both the terminal and GUI.

## How To Use
There are two different ways to use `files`, with the first being in the terminal, and the second being through GUI. To run the terminal version, type `import SoleStormCatPY.files` and `SoleStormCatPY.files.filesCMD()` into your terminal. For GUI, you can either run the main GUI app, or you can run `import SoleStormCatPY.files` and `SoleStormCatPY.files.filesGUI` into the terminal.

### Current Issues
SoleStormCat Corp. currently has knowledge of these issues:

1. Files has an issue when opening folders, saying "Permission Denied" (This has only been tested on Linux). There is currently no known fix to this. See more at Issue #1!
