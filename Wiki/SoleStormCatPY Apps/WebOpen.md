# WebOpen

"WebOpen" is not as it might see. It's not a web browser, but a web browser opener! You enter the URL of the website you want (including `http://`), and you'll be sent to the website. And, you also get to put in names for specific websites that lead to them with only the name!

## The Two Types of "WebOpen"

Yes, there are three versions of "WebOpen"! There is "WebGUI" (With GUI), "WebCMD" (With No GUI, Just Terminal), and "WebCMDgui" (GUI window, opens via terminal script). Here are their differences!

WebGUI:
WebGUI opens in a `tkinter` window, allowing users to enter their URL into a user-friendly box! (Requires the `tkinter`, `PyQT5`, and `PyQTWebEngine` modules)

WebCMD:
WebCMD opens in the standard terminal window, this is great for opening a website the developer wants! (THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH `.pyw` FILES!) (Requires `webbrowser` module!) (Opens in user's default browser)

WebCMDgui:
WebCMDgui allows you to input the website in the script, while opening the window in a SoleStormCat-Scripted window! (Requires `PyQT5` and `PyQTWebEngine` modules) (Does not use a user-specified browser, uses SoleStormCat-Scripted browser!)

## How To Use
To Run "WebOpen" in your script, make sure to specify `website` (being the URL (or name in some cases)) (with WebGUI Being an exeption), along with the command `SoleStormCatPY.WebOpen.webCMD(website)` (For WebCMD. Requires `webbrowser`), `import SoleStormCatPY.WebOpen.WebGUI()` (For WebGUI. Requires `PyQt5`, `PyQtWebEngine` and `tkinter`) or `SoleStormCatPY.WebOpen.webCMDgui(website)` (For WebCMDgui. Requires `PyQt5` and `PyQtWebEngine`)
Have Fun Webbing!

## Websites With Names:
This meantions the certain websites that you can access by name. The Format for this is (Name of Website with clickable URL), (Name input into App). Both WebCMD and WebGUI support this!
